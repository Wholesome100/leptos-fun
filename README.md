# Leptos Fun

This is a small CSR application to help me get more familiar with Rust WASM frameworks. 
Rust offers a compelling alternative to Javascript in the browser, although compatability and developer experience 
is still not as fleshed out as Javascript frameworks.

## Usage

Leptos Fun offers pages with a variety of common components and widgets to help drill web development and design. 
These can be interacted with from within the browser at the deployed URL, or the repository can be cloned locally, 
built with cargo and served with Trunk
